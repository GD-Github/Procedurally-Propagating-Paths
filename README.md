This is the open source repository for Procedurally Propagating Paths (PPP).

PPP is a tool for Unity, written in C#.

The goal of this tool is to create paths that are propagated through the colliders of a scene, and to use these paths to
either create visual effects or spawn objects.

Documentation and more details are available here:
